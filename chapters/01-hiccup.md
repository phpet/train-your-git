# Chapter 1: Hiccup's Tale
**test conflict**
Being a Viking? Pfft, that's for peasants.
While everyone else is pedaling around on their pathetic bicycles, complaining about the hot weather like a bunch of weaklings,
I'm cruising in my BMW M6 - the beast I earned during my "work" abroad in London.
Let me tell you about yesterday.
The sun was blazing, and I could see all those losers on their bikes, sweating like pigs, desperately trying to find shade.
Meanwhile, I'm rolling down my window just to laugh at them.
"Hey!" I shouted, "Maybe you should've gone to London and done some real work like I did!"
The English wheel I "acquired" during my time there gleamed proudly on my dashboard - a trophy of my entrepreneurial spirit.
Adrian Minune was right there in my backseat, belting out his beautiful cover of "Vara nu dorm" - that Connect-r song never sounded so good.
Adrian's voice mixed perfectly with the purr of my M6's engine as I accelerated past another group of bicycle riders.
"Vara nu dorm, vara nu dorm!" he sang, and I couldn't help but grin.
This was the life.
I've never missed a green light - not once.
And red lights? Please.
Those are just suggestions for people who don't know how to live.
24/7, baby.
That's how a real macho man operates.
As I downshifted around a corner, leaving a cloud of exhaust for the cyclists to enjoy,
I spotted something interesting in the forest.
A crashed Night Fury.
Now, most people would've gotten out and walked - but not me.
I drove my M6 right up to where the dragon was trapped.
Sitting in my air-conditioned luxury, Adrian still crooning in the background,
I looked at this pathetic creature through my tinted windows.
I could've finished it right there from the comfort of my leather seats.
I should have.
But you know what?
Even a macho man like me has standards.
I rolled down my window, tossed my English wheel in the air and caught it with one hand - just to show off - and made a decision that would change everything.
I let it go.
Not because I was soft, mind you.
But because real power is knowing when to use it.
Plus, Adrian had just started the second verse, and I wasn't about to interrupt a masterpiece.
As I drove away, leaving the dragon free and the cyclists still struggling in the heat,
I couldn't help but smile.
This was my story - Hiccup, the guy who went to London, got what he wanted, and came back a legend.
