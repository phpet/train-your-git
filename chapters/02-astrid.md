# Chapter 2: Astrid's Watch

Everyone knew who I was—Astrid Hofferson.  
I trained harder, hit harder, and aimed truer than anyone else in dragon training.  

I had to.  
Being the best wasn’t just about pride—it was about survival, about honor.  

I didn’t have time for weakness or distractions,  
especially not from Hiccup, the chief’s scrawny, awkward son  
who always seemed to be in the way.  

He was a joke.  
Or at least, he used to be.  

Something changed in him—  
suddenly, he wasn’t just surviving training,  
he was outsmarting it.  

Outsmarting *us*.  

And that made me curious...  
and maybe just a little suspicious.
