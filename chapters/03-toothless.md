# Chapter 3: Toothless Takes Flight

My name is Toothless, and let me tell you about the day everything changed – the day I got my wheels.

There I was, cruising through the skies of Berk in my pristine Dacia Logan, the engine purring like a contented dragon. The M3 badge gleaming proudly atop my steering wheel caught the sunlight just right, reminding everyone that I wasn't just any ordinary Night Fury – I was a Night Fury with style. My golden rear-view mirror, adorned with Nicu Paleru's complete CD collection, jingled softly as I navigated the aerial parking lots above the village. Those CDs weren't just for show; they helped me see better when maneuvering into tight spots between the clouds.

Below me, I could see Hiccup and the other riders trudging along barefoot on the rocky paths of Berk. Their feet must have been freezing against the cold stone, but they seemed determined to keep up with me somehow. I felt a pang of sympathy – after all, not everyone could afford the luxury of xenon headlights like mine.

Ah, my headlights – my pride and joy! I'd had them specially modified with a cocktail of rare gases: xenon for that brilliant white beam, argon for the subtle blue tint that made me look mysterious in the fog, and even a touch of neon for those special occasions when I wanted to make an entrance. The other dragons were jealous, I could tell. Stormfly kept trying to race me, but her wings were no match for my Dacia's reliable engine.

As I downshifted around a particularly sharp cloud formation, I caught sight of Hiccup waving at me from below. He was pointing frantically at something in the distance – probably another one of those Red Death situations. I sighed, the sound mixing with the gentle hum of my perfectly tuned exhaust system. Being the alpha dragon was tough work, but someone had to do it.

I pulled into a convenient cloud bank, engaging my parking brake with a satisfying click. The Nicu Paleru CDs chimed melodically as I adjusted my golden mirror to get a better view of the situation. Through my argon-enhanced headlights, I could see the problem clearly – a group of wild dragons causing trouble near the village.

Time to show them what a Night Fury with a Dacia could really do.

I revved my engine once, twice, then shot forward through the sky, my xenon beams cutting through the mist like plasma blasts. The M3 badge caught the wind just right, and I couldn't help but feel proud. This was what I was born for – protecting my friends, even if they insisted on walking everywhere barefoot like savages.

As I soared toward the danger, I could hear the faint melody of "Cine iubește și lasă" drifting from my rear-view mirror collection. Nicu Paleru always knew how to set the mood for a good fight.

This was my story – Toothless, the Night Fury with the golden touch and the best parking skills in all of Berk.
