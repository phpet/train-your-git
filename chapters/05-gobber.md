# Chapter 5: Gobber's Wisdom

## The Blacksmith's View

*Ah, another day in paradise,* I think as I watch Hiccup stumble through the village square, that dragon of his trailing behind like a loyal shadow. **Thirty years I've been swinging this hammer**, and I've seen plenty of young Vikings come and go, but none quite like that boy. 

The forge fire crackles as I work the bellows, and I can't help but chuckle at the memory of when Hiccup first walked into my smithy – *scrawny as a fish bone and twice as slippery*. Now look at him, **the Dragon Master himself**, teaching us old sea dogs that maybe, just maybe, there's more than one way to be a Viking.

*Who would've thought?* The runt of the litter becoming the bridge between two worlds. I pound the red-hot metal on my anvil, each strike echoing the rhythm of change that's swept through Berk. **Some days I feel like I'm watching history unfold right before my one good eye.**

Sure, I lost a hand and a foot to dragons back in the day, but watching Hiccup and Toothless soar through the clouds together? *That's worth more than any limb I ever had.* **The boy's got something special** – not the brawn we Vikings are known for, but something far more valuable: *the courage to see the world differently*.
